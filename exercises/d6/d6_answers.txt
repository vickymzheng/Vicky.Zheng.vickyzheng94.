1) git-init creates an empty repository, or reinitializesan existing one. 

2) "git add" stages a new file to your repository, and git commit updates your git changes. 

3) staged are things that are about to be committed (updated on github) and commit is things that have already been updated. I think of staged items as pending items.

4) git add --all; git commit 

5) You can go to github's site to see your previous commits.

7) You can download it from github, and then work on it from there.

2) Because it has the most people trying to take it down daily.

3) I think it allows you to update/share one specific part of your project

4) It allows you to access the current state of the uploaded project
